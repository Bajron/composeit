# Example service files

Example service files. They show/test some of the features.
Usually they use default OS applications or Python.

Sometimes there are differences per operating system
(e.g. different options to `ping`), so the examples are OS specific.

The `unios` example should work on Windows and on Linux (tested on Ubuntu).
